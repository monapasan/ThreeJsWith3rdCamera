# Trying it out !

#### If you don't have npm (Node Package Manager), you should first install [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/)

## Install with three lines

Just `git clone` & `npm install`:

```
git clone https://github.com/monapasan/ThreeJsWith3rdCamera.git
cd ThreeJsWith3rdCamera
npm install
```

This will install all dependencies, that you need for running the game.


## Then use it with one more

Run the dev server (Webpack):

```
npm start
```

Then open [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080/).

## Control
(W, A, Q, E = Move, A,D = Look around, Mouse Click - shooting)
